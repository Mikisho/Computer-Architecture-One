  * A given CPU can handle concurrency by using task _*task switching*_ thecnique, for exapmple, consider two tasks A & B and both needs to happen independently of eacn other. Then, CPU handles these two tasks in such a way that Task A works up to a certain point and CPU will work on it stops and it swithces over to task B, CPU works on it for a while and swithces back to task A. Thus, this is one of the techniques that a given CPU handles concurrency.

  * **Assembly language**: is a second generation language which is designed to write computer code in human understandble format. One way that assembly language is different from machine language is that its readability is very high.
  * **Machine language**: has a form of 0s and 1s which is not easily understandable by human but it is a real language that computer understands.

  * Graphics Cards are good in operations found in Machine learning such as convolutions or SGEMM operations. on the other hand, in Machine learning algorithms there are lots of simple operations which are not dependant one another and GPUs have lots of cores that can perform simple opreations in parallel.
